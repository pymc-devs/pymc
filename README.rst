PyMC (formerly PyMC3) is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling
focusing on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI)
algorithms. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a
large suite of problems.

Check out the `PyMC overview <https://docs.pymc.io/en/latest/learn/core_notebooks/pymc_overview.html>`__,  or
one of `the many examples <https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html>`__!
For questions on PyMC, head on over to our `PyMC Discourse <https://discourse.pymc.io/>`__ forum.

Features
========

-  Intuitive model specification syntax, for example, ``x ~ N(0,1)``
   translates to ``x = Normal('x',0,1)``
-  **Powerful sampling algorithms**, such as the `No U-Turn
   Sampler <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/hoffman14a.html>`__, allow complex models
   with thousands of parameters with little specialized knowledge of
   fitting algorithms.
-  **Variational inference**: `ADVI <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-107.html>`__
   for fast approximate posterior estimation as well as mini-batch ADVI
   for large data sets.
-  Relies on `PyTensor <https://pytensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ which provides:
    *  Computation optimization and dynamic C or JAX compilation
    *  NumPy broadcasting and advanced indexing
    *  Linear algebra operators
    *  Simple extensibility
-  Transparent support for missing value imputation


Linear Regression Example
==========================


Plant growth can be influenced by multiple factors, and understanding these relationships is crucial for optimizing agricultural practices.

Imagine we conduct an experiment to predict the growth of a plant based on different environmental variables.

.. code-block:: python

   import pymc as pm

   # Taking draws from a normal distribution
   seed = 42
   x_dist = pm.Normal.dist(shape=(100, 3))
   x_data = pm.draw(x_dist, random_seed=seed)

   # Independent Variables:
   # Sunlight Hours: Number of hours the plant is exposed to sunlight daily.
   # Water Amount: Daily water amount given to the plant (in milliliters).
   # Soil Nitrogen Content: Percentage of nitrogen content in the soil.


   # Dependent Variable:
   # Plant Growth (y): Measured as the increase in plant height (in centimeters) over a certain period.


   # Define coordinate values for all dimensions of the data
   coords={
    "trial": range(100),
    "features": ["sunlight hours", "water amount", "soil nitrogen"],
   }

   # Define generative model
   with pm.Model(coords=coords) as generative_model:
      x = pm.Data("x", x_data, dims=["trial", "features"])

      # Model parameters
      betas = pm.Normal("betas", dims="features")
      sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma")

      # Linear model
      mu = x @ betas

      # Likelihood
      # Assuming we measure deviation of each plant from baseline
      plant_growth = pm.Normal("plant growth", mu, sigma, dims="trial")


   # Generating data from model by fixing parameters
   fixed_parameters = {
    "betas": [5, 20, 2],
    "sigma": 0.5,
   }
   with pm.do(generative_model, fixed_parameters) as synthetic_model:
      idata = pm.sample_prior_predictive(random_seed=seed) # Sample from prior predictive distribution.
      synthetic_y = idata.prior["plant growth"].sel(draw=0, chain=0)


   # Infer parameters conditioned on observed data
   with pm.observe(generative_model, {"plant growth": synthetic_y}) as inference_model:
      idata = pm.sample(random_seed=seed)

      summary = pm.stats.summary(idata, var_names=["betas", "sigma"])
      print(summary)


From the summary, we can see that the mean of the inferred parameters are very close to the fixed parameters

.. code-block:: python

   # Simulate new data conditioned on inferred parameters
   new_x_data = pm.draw(
      pm.Normal.dist(shape=(3, 3)),
      random_seed=seed,
   )
   new_coords = coords | {"trial": [0, 1, 2]}

   with inference_model:
      pm.set_data({"x": new_x_data}, coords=new_coords)
      pm.sample_posterior_predictive(
         idata,
         predictions=True,
         extend_inferencedata=True,
         random_seed=seed,
      )

   pm.stats.summary(idata.predictions, kind="stats")

The new data conditioned on inferred parameters would look like:

.. code-block:: python

   # Simulate new data, under a scenario where the first beta is zero
   with pm.do(

    {inference_model["betas"]: inference_model["betas"] * [0, 1, 1]},
   ) as plant_growth_model:
      new_predictions = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(

         predictions=True,
         random_seed=seed,

   pm.stats.summary(new_predictions, kind="stats")
