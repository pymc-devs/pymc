<p>Say I download a handbook of a hundred jokes, and I&#8217;d like to know very
quickly which ones will be my favorite. So maybe I read a few, I laugh,
I read a few more, I stop laughing, and I indicate on a scale of -10 to
10 how funny I thought each joke was. Maybe I do this for 5 jokes out of
the 100. Now I go to the back of the book, and there&#8217;s a little program
included for calculating my preferences for all the other jokes. I enter
in my preference numbers and shazam! The program spits out a list of all
100 jokes, sorted in the order I&#8217;ll like them. That certainly would be
nice. Today we&#8217;ll write a program that does exactly this.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start out by getting some intuition for how our model will work.
Then we&#8217;ll formalize our intuition. Afterwards, we&#8217;ll examine the
dataset we are going to use. Once we have some notion of what our data
looks like, we&#8217;ll define some baseline methods for predicting
preferences for jokes. Following that, we&#8217;ll look at Probabilistic
Matrix Factorization (PMF), which is a more sophisticated Bayesian
method for predicting preferences. Having detailed the PMF model, we&#8217;ll
use PyMC3 for MAP estimation and MCMC inference. Finally, we&#8217;ll compare
the results obtained with PMF to those obtained from our baseline
methods and discuss the outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Intuition">
<h2>Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#Intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally if we want recommendations for something, we try to find people
who are similar to us and ask their opinions. If Bob, Alice, and Monty
are all similar to me, and they all like knock-knock jokes, I&#8217;ll
probably like knock-knock jokes. Now this isn&#8217;t always true. It depends
on what we consider to be &#8220;similar&#8221;. In order to get the best bang for
our buck, we really want to look for people who have the most similar
sense of humor. Humor being a complex beast, we&#8217;d probably like to break
it down into something more understandable. We might try to characterize
each joke in terms of various factors. Perhaps jokes can be dry,
sarcastic, crude, sexual, political, etc. Now imagine we go through our
handbook of jokes and assign each joke a rating in each of the
categories. How dry is it? How sarcastic is it? How much does it use
sexual innuendos? Perhaps we use numbers between 0 and 1 for each
category. Intuitively, we might call this the joke&#8217;s humor profile.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s suppose we go back to those 5 jokes we rated. At this point,
we can get a richer picture of our own preferences by looking at the
humor profiles of each of the jokes we liked and didn&#8217;t like. Perhaps we
take the averages across the 5 humor profiles and call this our ideal
type of joke. In other words, we have computed some notion of our
inherent <em>preferences</em> for various types of jokes. Suppose Bob, Alice,
and Monty all do the same. Now we can compare our preferences and
determine how similar each of us really are. I might find that Bob is
the most similar and the other two are still more similar than other
people, but not as much as Bob. So I want recommendations from all three
people, but when I make my final decision, I&#8217;m going to put more weight
on Bob&#8217;s recommendation than those I get from Alice and Monty.</p>
<p>While the above procedure sounds fairly effective as is, it also reveals
an unexpected additional source of information. If we rated a particular
joke highly, and we know its humor profile, we can compare with the
profiles of other jokes. If we find one with very close numbers, it is
probable we&#8217;ll also enjoy this joke. Both this approach and the one
above are commonly known as <em>neighborhood approaches</em>. Techniques that
leverage both of these approaches simultaneously are often called
<em>collaborative filtering</em>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/papers/ieeecomputer.pdf">[1]</a>.
The first approach we talked about uses user-user similarity, while the
second uses item-item similarity. Ideally, we&#8217;d like to use both sources
of information. The idea is we have a lot of items available to us, and
we&#8217;d like to work together with others to filter the list of items down
to those we&#8217;ll each like best. My list should have the items I&#8217;ll like
best at the top and those I&#8217;ll like least at the bottom. Everyone else
wants the same. If I get together with a bunch of other people, we all
read 5 jokes, and we have some efficient computational process to
determine similarity, we can very quickly order the jokes to our liking.</p>

<div class="section" id="Formalization">
<h2>Formalization<a class="headerlink" href="#Formalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take some time to make the intuitive notions we&#8217;ve been discussing
more concrete. We have a set of <span class="math">\(M\)</span> jokes, or <em>items</em>
(<span class="math">\(M = 100\)</span> in our example above). We also have <span class="math">\(N\)</span> people,
whom we&#8217;ll call <em>users</em> of our recommender system. For each item, we&#8217;d
like to find a <span class="math">\(D\)</span> dimensional factor composition (humor profile
above) to describe the item. Ideally, we&#8217;d like to do this without
actually going through and manually labeling all of the jokes. Manual
labeling would be both slow and error-prone, as different people will
likely label jokes differently. So we model each joke as a <span class="math">\(D\)</span>
dimensional vector, which is its latent factor composition. Furthermore,
we expect each user to have some preferences, but without our manual
labeling and averaging procedure, we have to rely on the latent factor
compositions to learn <span class="math">\(D\)</span> dimensional latent preference vectors
for each user. The only thing we get to observe is the
<span class="math">\(N \times M\)</span> ratings matrix <span class="math">\(R\)</span> provided by the users. Entry
<span class="math">\(R_{ij}\)</span> is the rating user <span class="math">\(i\)</span> gave to item <span class="math">\(j\)</span>. Many
of these entries may be missing, since most users will not have rated
all 100 jokes. Our goal is to fill in the missing values with predicted
ratings based on the latent variables <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. We denote
the predicted ratings by <span class="math">\(R_{ij}^*\)</span>. We also define an indicator
matrix <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, with entry <span class="math">\(I_{ij} = 0\)</span> if <span class="math">\(R_{ij}\)</span> is
missing and <span class="math">\(I_{ij} = 1\)</span> otherwise.</p>
<p>So we have an <span class="math">\(N \times D\)</span> matrix of user preferences which we&#8217;ll
call <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and an <span class="math">\(M \times D\)</span> factor composition matrix we&#8217;ll
call <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. We also have a <span class="math">\(N \times M\)</span> rating matrix we&#8217;ll
call <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. We can think of each row <span class="math">\(U_i\)</span> as indications of
how much each user prefers each of the <span class="math">\(D\)</span> latent factors. Each
row <span class="math">\(V_j\)</span> can be thought of as how much each item can be described
by each of the latent factors. In order to make a recommendation, we
need a suitable prediction function which maps a user preference vector
<span class="math">\(U_i\)</span> and an item latent factor vector <span class="math">\(V_j\)</span> to a predicted
ranking. The choice of this prediction function is an important modeling
decision, and a variety of prediction functions have been used. Perhaps
the most common is the dot product of the two vectors,
<span class="math">\(U_i \cdot V_j\)</span>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/papers/ieeecomputer.pdf">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>To better understand CF techniques, let us explore a particular example.
Imagine we are seeking to recommend jokes using a model which infers
five latent factors, <span class="math">\(V_j\)</span>, for <span class="math">\(j = 1,2,3,4,5\)</span>. In reality,
the latent factors are often unexplainable in a straightforward manner,
and most models make no attempt to understand what information is being
captured by each factor. However, for the purposes of explanation, let
us assume the five latent factors might end up capturing the humor
profile we were discussing above. So our five latent factors are: dry,
sarcastic, crude, sexual, and political. Then for a particular user
<span class="math">\(i\)</span>, imagine we infer a preference vector
<span class="math">\(U_i = &lt;0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3&gt;\)</span>. Also, for a particular item
<span class="math">\(j\)</span>, we infer these values for the latent factors:
<span class="math">\(V_j = &lt;0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.8, 0.9&gt;\)</span>. Using the dot product as the
prediction function, we would calculate 0.575 as the ranking for that
item, which is more or less a neutral preference given our -10 to 10
rating scale.</p>
<div class="math">
\[0.2 \times 0.5 + 0.1 \times 0.5 + 0.3 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.8 + 0.3 \times 0.9 = 0.575\]</div>

<div class="section" id="Data">
<h2>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#Data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/">v1 Jester dataset</a>
provides something very much like the handbook of jokes we have been
discussing. The original version of this dataset was constructed in
conjunction with the development of the <a class="reference external" href="http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/about.html">Eigentaste recommender
system</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/pubs/eigentaste.pdf">[2]</a>. At this
point in time, v1 contains over 4.1 million continuous ratings in the
range [-10, 10] of 100 jokes from 73,421 users. These ratings were
collected between Apr. 1999 and May 2003. In order to reduce the
training time of the model for illustrative purposes, 1,000 users who
have rated all 100 jokes will be selected randomly. We will implement a
model that is suitable for collaborative filtering on this data and
evaluate it in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) to validate the
results.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin by exploring our data. We want to get a general feel for
what it looks like and a sense for what sort of patterns it might
contain.</p>

<p>This must be a decent batch of jokes. From our exploration above, we
know most ratings are in the range -1 to 10, and positive ratings are
more likely than negative ratings. Let&#8217;s look at the means for each joke
to see if we have any particularly good (or bad) humor here.</p>

The worst joke:
---------------
How many teddybears does it take to change a lightbulb?

It takes only one teddybear, but it takes a whole lot of lightbulbs.


The best joke:
--------------
*A radio conversation of a US naval
ship with Canadian authorities ... *

Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a
collision.

Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the South to
avoid a collision.

Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship.  I say again, divert
YOUR course.

Canadians: No.  I say again, you divert YOUR course.

Americans: This is the aircraft carrier USS LINCOLN, the second largest ship in the United States&#39; Atlantic Fleet. We are accompanied by three destroyers, three cruisers and numerous support vessels. I demand that you change your course 15 degrees north, that&#39;s ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, or counter-measures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship.

Canadians: *This is a lighthouse.  Your call*.

<p>Make sense to me. We now know there are definite popularity differences
between the jokes. Some of them are simply funnier than others, and some
are downright lousy. Looking at the joke means allowed us to discover
these general trends. Perhaps there are similar trends across users. It
might be the case that some users are simply more easily humored than
others. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>

<p>We see even more significant trends here. Some users rate nearly
everything highly, and some (though not as many) rate nearly everything
negatively. These observations will come in handy when considering
models to use for predicting user preferences on unseen jokes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Methods">
<h2>Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#Methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having explored the data, we&#8217;re now ready to dig in and start addressing
the problem. We want to predict how much each user is going to like all
of the jokes he or she has not yet read.</p>
<div class="section" id="Baselines">
<h3>Baselines<a class="headerlink" href="#Baselines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every good analysis needs some kind of baseline methods to compare
against. It&#8217;s difficult to claim we&#8217;ve produced good results if we have
no reference point for what defines &#8220;good&#8221;. We&#8217;ll define three very
simple baseline methods and find the RMSE using these methods. Our goal
will be to obtain lower RMSE scores with whatever model we produce.</p>
<div class="section" id="Uniform-Random-Baseline">
<h4>Uniform Random Baseline<a class="headerlink" href="#Uniform-Random-Baseline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Our first baseline is about as dead stupid as you can get. Every place
we see a missing value in <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, we&#8217;ll simply fill it with a number
drawn uniformly at random in the range [-10, 10]. We expect this method
to do the worst by far.</p>
<div class="math">
\[R_{ij}^* \sim Uniform\]</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Global-Mean-Baseline">
<h4>Global Mean Baseline<a class="headerlink" href="#Global-Mean-Baseline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This method is only slightly better than the last. Wherever we have a
missing value, we&#8217;ll fill it in with the mean of all observed ratings.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\text{global_mean} = \frac{1}{N \times M} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M I_{ij}(R_{ij})\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[R_{ij}^* = \text{global_mean}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Mean-of-Means-Baseline">
<h4>Mean of Means Baseline<a class="headerlink" href="#Mean-of-Means-Baseline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now we&#8217;re going to start getting a bit smarter. We imagine some users
might be easily amused, and inclined to rate all jokes more highly.
Other users might be the opposite. Additionally, some jokes might simply
be more witty than others, so all users might rate some jokes more
highly than others in general. We can clearly see this in our graph of
the joke means above. We&#8217;ll attempt to capture these general trends
through per-user and per-joke rating means. We&#8217;ll also incorporate the
global mean to smooth things out a bit. So if we see a missing value in
cell <span class="math">\(R_{ij}\)</span>, we&#8217;ll average the global mean with the mean of
<span class="math">\(U_i\)</span> and the mean of <span class="math">\(V_j\)</span> and use that value to fill it
in.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\text{user_means} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M I_{ij}(R_{ij})\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\text{joke_means} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I_{ij}(R_{ij})\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[R_{ij}^* = \frac{1}{3} \left(\text{user_means}_i + \text{ joke_means}_j + \text{ global_mean} \right)\]</div>

<h2>Probabilistic Matrix Factorization<a class="headerlink" href="#Probabilistic-Matrix-Factorization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3208-probabilistic-matrix-factorization.pdf">Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
(PMF)</a>
[3] is a probabilistic approach to the collaborative filtering problem
that takes a Bayesian perspective. The ratings <span class="math">\(R\)</span> are modeled as
draws from a Gaussian distribution. The mean for <span class="math">\(R_{ij}\)</span> is
<span class="math">\(U_i V_j^T\)</span>. The precision <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a fixed parameter
that reflects the uncertainty of the estimations; the normal
distribution is commonly reparameterized in terms of precision, which is
the inverse of the variance. Complexity is controlled by placing
zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors on <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. In other
words, each row of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian with
mean <span class="math">\(\mu = 0\)</span> and precision which is some multiple of the
identity matrix <span class="math">\(I\)</span>. Those multiples are <span class="math">\(\alpha_U\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\alpha_V\)</span> for <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. So our model is defined
by:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\newcommand\given[1][]{\:#1\vert\:}\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
P(R \given U, V, \alpha^2) =
    \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^M
        \left[ \mathcal{N}(R_{ij} \given U_i V_j^T, \alpha^{-1}) \right]^{I_{ij}}
\end{equation}</div><div class="math">
\begin{equation}
P(U \given \alpha_U^2) =
    \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{N}(U_i \given 0, \alpha_U^{-1} \boldsymbol{I})
\end{equation}</div><div class="math">
\begin{equation}
P(V \given \alpha_U^2) =
    \prod_{j=1}^M \mathcal{N}(V_j \given 0, \alpha_V^{-1} \boldsymbol{I})
\end{equation}</div><p>Given small precision parameters, the priors on <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span>
ensure our latent variables do not grow too far from 0. This prevents
overly strong user preferences and item factor compositions from being
learned. This is commonly known as complexity control, where the
complexity of the model here is measured by the magnitude of the latent
variables. Controlling complexity like this helps prevent overfitting,
which allows the model to generalize better for unseen data. We must
also choose an appropriate <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> value for the normal
distribution for <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. So the challenge becomes choosing
appropriate values for <span class="math">\(\alpha_U\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\alpha_V\)</span>, and
<span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. This challenge can be tackled with the soft
weight-sharing methods discussed by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/sunspots.pdf">Nowland and Hinton,
1992</a> [4].
However, for the purposes of this analysis, we will stick to using point
estimates obtained from our data.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also need functions for calculating the MAP and performing
sampling on our PMF model. When the observation noise variance
<span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and the prior variances <span class="math">\(\alpha_U\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\alpha_V\)</span> are all kept fixed, maximizing the log posterior is
equivalent to minimizing the sum-of-squared-errors objective function
with quadratic regularization terms.</p>
<div class="math">
\[E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M I_{ij} (R_{ij} - U_i V_j^T)^2 + \frac{\lambda_U}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \|U\|_{Fro}^2 + \frac{\lambda_V}{2} \sum_{j=1}^M \|V\|_{Fro}^2,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\lambda_U = \alpha_U / \alpha\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(\lambda_V = \alpha_V / \alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\|\cdot\|_{Fro}^2\)</span>
denotes the Frobenius norm [3]. Minimizing this objective function gives
a local minimum, which is essentially a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimate. While it is possible to use a fast Stochastic Gradient Descent
procedure to find this MAP, we&#8217;ll be finding it using the utilities
built into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pymc3</span></code>. In particular, we&#8217;ll use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_MAP</span></code> with Powell
optimization (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scipy.optimize.fmin_powell</span></code>). Having found this MAP
estimate, we can use it as our starting point for MCMC sampling.</p>
<p>Since it is a reasonably complex model, we expect the MAP estimation to
take some time. So let&#8217;s save it after we&#8217;ve found it. Note that we
define a function for finding the MAP below, assuming it will receive a
namespace with some variables in it. Then we attach that function to the
PMF class, where it will have such a namespace after initialization. The
PMF class is defined in pieces this way so I can say a few things
between each piece to make it clearer.</p>

<p>One final thing to note: the dot products in this model are often
constrained using a logistic function <span class="math">\(g(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x))\)</span>,
that bounds the predictions to the range [0, 1]. To facilitate this
bounding, the ratings are also mapped to the range [0, 1] using
<span class="math">\(t(x) = (x + min) / range\)</span>. The authors of PMF also introduced a
constrained version which performs better on users with less ratings
[3]. Both models are generally improvements upon the basic model
presented here. However, in the interest of time and space, these will
not be implemented here.</p>

<p>In order to understand how effective our models are, we&#8217;ll need to be
able to evaluate them. We&#8217;ll be evaluating in terms of root mean squared
error (RMSE), which looks like this:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
RMSE = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M I_{ij} (R_{ij} - R_{ij}^*)^2 }
                   { \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M I_{ij} } }
\end{equation}</div><p>In this case, the RMSE can be thought of as the standard deviation of
our predictions from the actual user preferences.</p>

<p>The next thing we need to do is split our data into a training set and a
test set. Matrix factorization techniques use <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_%28machine_learning%29">transductive
learning</a>
rather than inductive learning. So we produce a test set by taking a
random sample of the cells in the full <span class="math">\(N \times M\)</span> data matrix.
The values selected as test samples are replaced with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nan</span></code> values in
a copy of the original data matrix to produce the training set. Since
we&#8217;ll be producing random splits, let&#8217;s also write out the train/test
sets generated. This will allow us to replicate our results. We&#8217;d like
to be able to idenfity which split is which, so we&#8217;ll take a hash of the
indices selected for testing and use that to save the data.</p>

<p>Excellent. The first thing we want to do is make sure the MAP estimate
we obtained is reasonable. We can do this by computing RMSE on the
predicted ratings obtained from the MAP values of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(V\)</span>. First we define a function for generating the predicted
ratings <span class="math">\(R\)</span> from <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. We ensure the actual
rating bounds are enforced by setting all values below -10 to -10 and
all values above 10 to 10. Finally, we compute RMSE for both the
training set and the test set. We expect the test RMSE to be higher. The
difference between the two gives some idea of how much we have overfit.
Some difference is always expected, but a very low RMSE on the training
set with a high RMSE on the test set is a definite sign of overfitting.</p>

<p>So we see a pretty nice improvement here when compared to our best
baseline, which was the mean of means method. We also have a fairly
small difference in the RMSE values between the train and the test sets.
This indicates that the point estimates for <span class="math">\(\alpha_U\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\alpha_V\)</span> that we calculated from our data are doing a good job
of controlling model complexity. Now let&#8217;s see if we can improve our
estimates by approximating our posterior distribution with MCMC
sampling. We&#8217;ll draw 1000 samples and back them up using the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pymc3.backend.Text</span></code> backend.</p>

<p>The next step is to check how many samples we should discard as burn-in.
Normally, we&#8217;d do this using a traceplot to get some idea of where the
sampled variables start to converge. In this case, we have
high-dimensional samples, so we need to find a way to approximate them.
One way was proposed by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/bpmf.pdf">Salakhutdinov and Mnih,
p.886</a>. We can
calculate the Frobenius norms of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span> at each step
and monitor those for convergence. This essentially gives us some idea
when the average magnitude of the latent variables is stabilizing. The
equations for the Frobenius norms of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span> are shown
below. We will use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code>&#8216;s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">linalg</span></code> package to calculate these.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\|U\|_{Fro}^2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{d=1}^D |U_{id}|^2}, \hspace{40pt} \|V\|_{Fro}^2 = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^M \sum_{d=1}^D |V_{jd}|^2}\]</div>

<p>It appears we get convergence of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span> after about 200
samples. When testing for convergence, we also want to see convergence
of the particular statistics we are looking for, since different
characteristics of the posterior may converge at different rates. Let&#8217;s
also do a traceplot of the RSME. We&#8217;ll compute RMSE for both the train
and the test set, even though the convergence is indicated by RMSE on
the training set alone. In addition, let&#8217;s compute a running RMSE on the
train/test sets to see how aggregate performance improves or decreases
as we continue to sample.</p>

<p>We have some interesting results here. As expected, our MCMC sampler
provides lower error on the training set. However, it seems it does so
at the cost of overfitting the data. This results in a decrease in test
RMSE as compared to the MAP, even though it is still much better than
our best baseline. So why might this be the case? Recall that we used
point estimates for our precision paremeters <span class="math">\(\alpha_U\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\alpha_V\)</span> and we chose a fixed precision <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. It is
quite likely that by doing this, we constrained our posterior in a way
that biased it towards the training data. In reality, the variance in
the user ratings and the joke ratings is unlikely to be equal to the
means of sample variances we used. Also, the most reasonable observation
precision <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is likely different as well.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#Summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We set out to predict user preferences for unseen jokes. First we
discussed the intuitive notion behind the user-user and item-item
neighborhood approaches to collaborative filtering. Then we formalized
our intuitions. With a firm understanding of our problem context, we
moved on to exploring our subset of the Jester data. After discovering
some general patterns, we defined three baseline methods: uniform
random, global mean, and mean of means. With the goal of besting our
baseline methods, we implemented the basic version of Probabilistic
Matrix Factorization (PMF) using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pymc3</span></code>.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the mean of means method is our best
baseline on our prediction task. As expected, we are able to obtain a
significant decrease in RMSE using the PMF MAP estimate obtained via
Powell optimization. We illustrated one way to monitor convergence of an
MCMC sampler with a high-dimensionality sampling space using the
Frobenius norms of the sampled variables. The traceplots using this
method seem to indicate that our sampler converged to the posterior.
Results using this posterior showed that attempting to improve the MAP
estimation using MCMC sampling actually overfit the training data and
increased test RMSE. This was likely caused by the constraining of the
posterior via fixed precision parameters <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(\alpha_U\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\alpha_V\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a followup to this analysis, it would be interesting to also
implement the logistic and constrained versions of PMF. We expect both
models to outperform the basic PMF model. We could also implement the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/bpmf.pdf">fully Bayesian version of
PMF</a> (BPMF), which
places hyperpriors on the model parameters to automatically learn ideal
mean and precision parameters for <span class="math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. This would
likely resolve the issue we faced in this analysis. We would expect BPMF
to improve upon the MAP estimation produced here by learning more
suitable hyperparameters and parameters. For a basic (but working!)
implementation of BPMF in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pymc3</span></code>, see <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/macks22/00a17b1d374dfc267a9a">this
gist</a>.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, then congratulations! You now have some idea of
how to build a basic recommender system. These same ideas and methods
can be used on many different recommendation tasks. Items can be movies,
products, advertisements, courses, or even other people. Any time you
can build yourself a user-item matrix with user preferences in the
cells, you can use these types of collaborative filtering algorithms to
predict the missing values. If you want to learn more about recommender
systems, the first reference is a good place to start.</p>
