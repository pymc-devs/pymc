<h2>12.1. Monte Carlo Methods in Bayesian Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#monte-carlo-methods-in-bayesian-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bayesian analysis often requires integration over multiple dimensions that is
intractable both via analytic methods or standard methods of numerical
integration. However, it is often possible to compute these integrals by
simulating (drawing samples) from posterior distributions. For example,
consider the expected value of a random variable <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[E[{\bf x}] = \int {\bf x} f({\bf x}) d{\bf x}, \qquad
{\bf x} = \{x_1,...,x_k\}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> (the dimension of vector <span class="math">\(x\)</span>) is perhaps very large. If
we can produce a reasonable number of random vectors <span class="math">\(\{{\bf x_i}\}\)</span>, we
can use these values to approximate the unknown integral. This process is known
as <em>Monte Carlo integration</em>. In general, MC integration allows integrals
against probability density functions:</p>
<div class="math">
\[I = \int h(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{dx}\]</div>
<p>to be estimated by finite sums:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\hat{I} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n h(\mathbf{x}_i),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}_i\)</span> is a sample from <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. This estimate is valid
and useful because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>By the strong law of large numbers:</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[\hat{I} \rightarrow I   \mbox{   with probability 1}\]</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Simulation error can be measured and controlled:</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[   \begin{equation}Var(\hat{I}) = \frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^n
   (h(\mathbf{x}_i)-\hat{I})^2\end{equation}\]</div><p>Why is this relevant to Bayesian analysis? If we replace <span class="math">\(f(\mathbf{x})\)</span>
with a posterior, <span class="math">\(f(\theta|d)\)</span> and make <span class="math">\(h(\theta)\)</span> an interesting
function of the unknown parameter, the resulting expectation is that of the
posterior of <span class="math">\(h(\theta)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[ \begin{equation}
 E[h(\theta)|d] = \int f(\theta|d) h(\theta) d\theta \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n h(\theta)
 \end{equation}\]</div><div class="section" id="rejection-sampling">
<h3>12.1.1. Rejection Sampling<a class="headerlink" href="#rejection-sampling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Though Monte Carlo integration allows us to estimate integrals that are
unassailable by analysis and standard numerical methods, it relies on the
ability to draw samples from the posterior distribution. For known parametric
forms, this is not a problem; probability integral transforms or bivariate
techniques (e.g Box-Muller method) may be used to obtain samples from uniform
pseudo-random variates generated from a computer. Often, however, we cannot
readily generate random values from non-standard posteriors. In such instances,
we can use rejection sampling to generate samples.</p>
<p>Posit a function, <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> which can be evaluated for any value on the
support of <span class="math">\(x:S_x = [A,B]\)</span>, but may not be integrable or easily sampled
from. If we can calculate the maximum value of <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>, we can then define
a rectangle that is guaranteed to contain all possible values <span class="math">\((x,f(x))\)</span>.
It is then trivial to generate points over the box and enumerate the values
that fall under the curve (Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#bound"><em>Rejection sampling of a bounded form. Area is estimated by the ratio of
accepted (open squares) to total points, multiplied by the rectangle
area.</em></a>).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="bound">

<p class="caption">Rejection sampling of a bounded form. Area is estimated by the ratio of
accepted (open squares) to total points, multiplied by the rectangle
area.</p>
</div>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\mbox{Points under curve}}{\mbox{Points generated}} \times \mbox{box area} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_A^B f(x) dx\]</div>
<p>This approach is useful, for example, in estimating the normalizing constant
for posterior distributions.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="envelope">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/envelope.png"><img alt="envelope figure" src="_images/envelope.png" style="width: 480.0px; height: 480.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Rejection sampling of an unbounded form using an enveloping distribution.</p>
</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> has unbounded support (i.e. infinite tails), such as a Gaussian
distribution, a bounding box is no longer appropriate. We must specify a
majorizing (or, enveloping) function, <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span>, which implies:</p>
<div class="math">
\[g(x) \ge  f(x) \qquad\forall x \in (-\infty,\infty)\]</div>
<p>Having done this, we can now sample <span class="math">\({x_i}\)</span> from <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> and accept
or reject each of these values based upon <span class="math">\(f(x_i)\)</span>. Specifically, for
each draw <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, we also draw a uniform random variate <span class="math">\(u_i\)</span> and
accept <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> if <span class="math">\(u_i &lt; f(x_i)/cg(x_i)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is a
constant (Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#envelope"><em>Rejection sampling of an unbounded form using an enveloping distribution.</em></a>). This approach is made more efficient by
choosing an enveloping distribution that is &#8220;close&#8221; to the target distribution,
thus maximizing the number of accepted points. Further improvement is gained by
using optimized algorithms such as importance sampling which, as the name
implies, samples more frequently from important areas of the distribution.</p>
<p>Rejection sampling is usually subject to declining performance as the dimension
of the parameter space increases, so it is used less frequently than MCMC for
evaluation of posterior distributions <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#gamerman1997">[Gamerman1997]</a>.</p>

<h2>12.2. Markov Chains<a class="headerlink" href="#markov-chains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Markov chain is a special type of <em>stochastic process</em>. The standard
definition of a stochastic process is an ordered collection of random variables:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\{X_t:t \in T\}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is frequently (but not necessarily) a time index. If we think
of <span class="math">\(X_t\)</span> as a state <span class="math">\(X\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, and invoke the following
dependence condition on each state:</p>
<div class="math">
\[Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t, X_{t-1}=x_{t-1},\ldots,X_0=x_0) = Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t)\]</div>
<p>then the stochastic process is known as a Markov chain. This conditioning
specifies that the future depends on the current state, but not past states.
Thus, the Markov chain wanders about the state space, remembering only where it
has just been in the last time step. The collection of transition probabilities
is sometimes called a <em>transition matrix</em> when dealing with discrete states, or
more generally, a <em>transition kernel</em>.</p>
<p>In the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo, it is useful to think of the
Markovian property as &#8220;mild non-independence&#8221;. MCMC allows us to indirectly
generate independent samples from a particular posterior distribution.</p>

<h2>12.3. Why MCMC Works: Reversible Markov Chains<a class="headerlink" href="#why-mcmc-works-reversible-markov-chains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Markov chain Monte Carlo simulates a Markov chain for which some function of
interest (<em>e.g.</em> the joint distribution of the parameters of some model) is the
unique, invariant limiting distribution. An invariant distribution with respect
to some Markov chain with transition kernel <span class="math">\(Pr(y \mid x)\)</span> implies that:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_x Pr(y \mid x) \pi(x) dx = \pi(y).\]</div>
<p>Invariance is guaranteed for any <strong>reversible</strong> Markov chain. Consider a Markov
chain in reverse sequence:
<span class="math">\(\{\theta^{(n)},\theta^{(n-1)},...,\theta^{(0)}\}\)</span>. This sequence is still
Markovian, because:</p>
<div class="math">
\[Pr(\theta^{(k)}=y \mid \theta^{(k+1)}=x,\theta^{(k+2)}=x_1,\ldots ) = Pr(\theta^{(k)}=y \mid \theta^{(k+1)}=x)\]</div>
<p>Forward and reverse transition probabilities may be related through Bayes
theorem:</p>
<div class="math">
</div>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{Pr(\theta^{(k+1)}=x \mid \theta^{(k)}=y) \pi^{(k)}(y)}{\pi^{(k+1)}(x)}\]</div>
<p>Though not homogeneous in general, <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> becomes homogeneous if <strong>Do you
ever call the stationary distribution itself homogeneous?</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\pi^{(i)}=\pi\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(i &lt; k\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If this chain is homogeneous it is called reversible, because it satisfies the
<strong>detailed balance equation</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\pi(x)Pr(y \mid x) = \pi(y) Pr(x \mid y)\]</div>
<p>Reversibility is important because it has the effect of balancing movement
through the entire state space. When a Markov chain is reversible, <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>
is the unique, invariant, stationary distribution of that chain. Hence, if
<span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> is of interest, we need only find the reversible Markov chain for
which <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> is the limiting distribution. This is what MCMC does!</p>

<h2>12.4. Gibbs Sampling<a class="headerlink" href="#gibbs-sampling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Gibbs sampler is the simplest and most prevalent MCMC algorithm. If a
posterior has <span class="math">\(k\)</span> parameters to be estimated, we may condition each
parameter on current values of the other <span class="math">\(k-1\)</span> parameters, and sample from
the resultant distributional form (usually easier), and repeat this operation on
the other parameters in turn. This procedure generates samples from the
posterior distribution. Note that we have now combined Markov chains
(conditional independence) and Monte Carlo techniques (estimation by simulation)
to yield Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>Here is a stereotypical Gibbs sampling algorithm:</p>
<p>As we can see from the algorithm, each distribution is conditioned on the last
iteration of its chain values, constituting a Markov chain as advertised. The
Gibbs sampler has all of the important properties outlined in the previous
section: it is aperiodic, homogeneous and ergodic. Once the sampler converges,
all subsequent samples are from the target distribution. This convergence occurs
at a geometric rate.</p>

<h2>12.5. The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#the-metropolis-hastings-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The key to success in applying the Gibbs sampler to the estimation of Bayesian
posteriors is being able to specify the form of the complete conditionals of
<span class="math">\({\bf \theta}\)</span>. In fact, the algorithm cannot be implemented without them.
Of course, the posterior conditionals cannot always be neatly specified. In
contrast to the Gibbs algorithm, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates
candidate state transitions from an alternate distribution, and accepts or
rejects each candidate probabilistically.</p>
<p>Let us first consider a simple Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for a single
parameter, <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>. We will use a standard sampling distribution,
referred to as the <em>proposal distribution</em>, to produce candidate variables
<span class="math">\(q_t(\theta^{\prime} | \theta)\)</span>. That is, the generated value,
<span class="math">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span>, is a <em>possible</em> next value for <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> at step
<span class="math">\(t+1\)</span>. We also need to be able to calculate the probability of moving back
to the original value from the candidate, or
<span class="math">\(q_t(\theta | \theta^{\prime})\)</span>. These probabilistic ingredients are used
to define an <em>acceptance ratio</em>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[a(\theta^{\prime},\theta) = \frac{q_t(\theta^{\prime} | \theta) \pi(\theta^{\prime})}{q_t(\theta | \theta^{\prime}) \pi(\theta)}\]</div>
<p>The value of <span class="math">\(\theta^{(t+1)}\)</span> is then determined by:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\theta^{(t+1)} = \left\{\begin{array}{l&#64;{\quad \mbox{with prob.} \quad}l}\theta^{\prime} &amp; \min(a(\theta^{\prime},\theta),1) \\ \theta^{(t)} &amp; 1 - \min(a(\theta^{\prime},\theta),1) \end{array}\right.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This transition kernel implies that movement is not guaranteed at every step. It
only occurs if the suggested transition is likely based on the acceptance ratio.</p>
<p>A single iteration of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm proceeds as follows:</p>
<p>The original form of the algorithm specified by Metropolis required that
<span class="math">\(q_t(\theta^{\prime} | \theta) = q_t(\theta | \theta^{\prime})\)</span>, which
reduces <span class="math">\(a(\theta^{\prime},\theta)\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(\pi(\theta^{\prime})/\pi(\theta)\)</span>, but this is not necessary. In either
case, the state moves to high-density points in the distribution with high
probability, and to low-density points with low probability. After convergence,
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm describes the full target posterior density,
so all points are recurrent.</p>

<h3>12.5.1. Random-walk Metropolis-Hastings<a class="headerlink" href="#random-walk-metropolis-hastings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A practical implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm makes use of a
random-walk proposal. Recall that a random walk is a Markov chain that evolves
according to:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(t+1)} &=& \theta^{(t)} + \epsilon_t \\
\epsilon_t &\sim& f(\phi)
\end{eqnarray*}\]</div><p>As applied to the MCMC sampling, the random walk is used as a proposal
distribution, whereby dependent proposals are generated according to:</p>
<div class="math">
\[q(\theta^{\prime} | \theta^{(t)}) = f(\theta^{\prime} - \theta^{(t)}) = \theta^{(t)} + \epsilon_t\]</div>
<p>Generally, the density generating <span class="math">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> is symmetric about zero,
resulting in a symmetric chain. Chain symmetry implies that
<span class="math">\(q(\theta^{\prime} | \theta^{(t)}) = q(\theta^{(t)} | \theta^{\prime})\)</span>,
which reduces the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio to:</p>
<div class="math">
\[a(\theta^{\prime},\theta) = \frac{\pi(\theta^{\prime})}{\pi(\theta)}\]</div>
<p>The choice of the random walk distribution for <span class="math">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> is frequently
a normal or Student&#8217;s <span class="math">\(t\)</span> density, but it may be any distribution that
generates an irreducible proposal chain.</p>
<p>An important consideration is the specification of the scale parameter for the
random walk error distribution. Large values produce random walk steps that are
highly exploratory, but tend to produce proposal values in the tails of the
target distribution, potentially resulting in very small acceptance rates.
Conversely, small values tend to be accepted more frequently, since they tend to
produce proposals close to the current parameter value, but may result in chains
that mix very slowly. Some simulation studies suggest optimal acceptance rates
in the range of 20-50%. It is often worthwhile to optimize the proposal variance
by iteratively adjusting its value, according to observed acceptance rates early
in the MCMC simulation <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#gamerman1997">[Gamerman1997]</a>.</p>
