General Comments
----------------

The guide is well written and concise. The writing style is relaxed, which makes reading the guide a pleasant experience compared to R's terse and formal documents. I think the
document describes in enough details the general working of pymc, though some users would probably be thankful for more examples. Since the intended audience probably goes from python novices to experts and MCMC newbies to gurus and all permutations, it is probably worthwhile to flesh out the introduction to provide more references and state the assumed competence of readers with respect to these topics. 

With respect to the document structure, the only serious glitch I see is the theoretical section on Monte-Carlo methods. It appears right between the `Tutorial` and the `Building Model` sections. In a sense, it distracts readers from the main topic which is understanding how pymc works and what it can do. My feeling is that it would be more appropriate as an appendix, with ample references to it in the text. Apart from that, an abstract and a conclusion are missing. 
[AP] Do we really need an abstract and conclusion, even for JSS?
[DH] Maybe not an abstract, but some kind of conclusion (what's next, get involved, ...) would still be nice. 

Specific Comments
-----------------

 * Use the JSS style.
 * In the logo on the first page, the ship's trace has weird looking diagonal cuts. [AP] I'll work on it.
 * I had trouble latexing the file, specifically, I had to comment the includegraphics call for the poor_mixing figure (got endcsname errors), and bibtex complains about a missing cross-ref to Bernardo, altough it is there in the bib file. 
 * Harmonize class names typeface.

4-7   	The intro needs to be fleshed out, with more examples of usage and a description of the structure of the document. 
8 		The features are a bit ragtag. Try to put some uniformity in there, bullet point style.
28 		Not sure an example of usage should go in so early in the text. 
[AP] I like this bit here- I think it has a good chance of hooking window-shoppers with short attention spans.
60   	Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
61		The choice... maybe give more arguments to switch away from BUGS. 
[AP] I think we should studiously avoid saying anything bad about BUGS or R, even if it means being less-than-explicit about the pros and cons, and just let people make their own decisions based on the features.
89 		replace g77 with gfortran, add a note about intel's compiler issues. 
91 		The instructions would probably be simpler if the binaries and source were all on pypi. This needs to be done anyway, so it is as well to document the way it is going to be. 
131		import pymc; pymc.test() 
[CF] I would keep it a 2-line operation
138 	Add mailing list info and link. 


160 	Should we put the node graph ? 
[AP] Tricky one. Ecologists seem to dislike node graphs for the most part, but some of the machine learning types that have been cropping up on the list would like them.
[CF] I just published one in Endangered Species Research, and they did not seem to mind. They are particularly useful for very complex models.
178		Wondering if it would be best to replace from pymc import ... by import pymc.
[AP] In the tutorial, I'd vote for from pymc import *.
[CF] from pymc import * is almost universally discouraged these days, because of namespace concerns. Dont want to encourage bad habits ...
180 	doc = "Switchpoint [year]"
273		Explain the new interface to the traces. 
[AP] Actually, you ought to update this with the new trace slicing conventions.



333		simulating (drawing samples)
315		where $k$, the dimension of vector x, is perhaps...
342		pi is generally used for priors, no ? And later it denotes a Markov chain.
367		g(x) >= f(x)
359 	how is $k$ defined ? Generally, we see Mg(x) >= f(x) and u_i < f(x_i)/ M g(x_i)
377 	The exchangeability footnote is not clear to me. Are we talking about autocorrelation or correlation between variables ?
399 	The equation compares a bivariate distribution and a univariate distribution. Is this correct ? Not sure I understand what that means. 


494		random: ...
[AP] Throughout the building models section, should we really document the arguments in such detail or should we leave that for the API reference? If we decide to keep the detail, we need to make sure it's in sync with the current API. There are bound to be some differences.
[DH] I'd leave the lower level details for the API document. 
530		np.inf, np.log
538 	NumPy
538		SciPy's implementation of distributions is 10 times slower than pymc.
[AP] Again, I think we should avoid saying anything bad about other packages; people will figure this out.
[DH] OK, but then we shouldn't say that SciPy's functions are fast. 
556		rseed is not a seed for the random generator, just a flag to signal the variable should be randomly sampled before sampling to provide a starting point. 
[AP] Oh, I had no idea!
564		Can we put this in a box or side-bar ? Integrate it visually as a CAUTION/WARNING ?
[AP] That would be better. I don't know how to do that in standard latex.
576		Should we replace @data by @observed ? Less chance of conflict with user defined variables. 
[AP] This ticket still hasn't been resolved...
577		This sentence is a bit weird. 
579 	changed, and it won't be sampled by the fitting method. 
589		Type face of deterministic
592		Type face of deterministic
595 	Thanks ... this has already been said. 
597 	the user doesn't ... already been said.
[AP] It's OK if we repeat ourselves a bit. People are going to flip to the page they want, not read through like a novel. 
606		typeface of index
607		typeface of index
624 	also a plot argument I guess. 
632		Put that paragraph in a footnote. 
638	 	In the equation, put the i=0,...,N-2 at the right of the second line. 
642		This is a detail, but you could do without the last_x variable and use mu=x[-1]
643		The python expression... isn't it evident ?
[AP] Just trying to noob-proof it to the extent possible. Fine with taking it out.
728		I understand what this means, but doubt this is valid Python. 
[AP] Sure it is!
[DH] Well, well, well. I'm dumbfounded. 
761		What happens for stochs without random method ?
[AP] It _should_ raise an error.
764		only stochs whose rseed attribute is not None are changed.
770		representations (see ...). 
[AP] Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, Jordan
788		output_path is not supported by the db backends.
807		The call arguments to Sampler needs to be updated. 
807		document calc_deviance: whether or not a deviance deterministic should be created. 
811		isn't length==iter ?
[AP] This text dates back to the stone age...
819		database. The actual write operation depends on the database backend chosen, see ...
820		This is not supported yet for sqlite and mysql.
824		Explain that trace_index is different from the sampler's index (in MCMC), since some iterations might not be saved due to burn and thin arguments. 
825	 	calc_deviance
827		Maybe say a few words about the fact that the parameters of the multivariate normal are estimated using derivatives at the maximum a posteriori values: variances are estimated using partial derivatives and correlation coefficients using mixed partial derivatives ( and this is why discrete variables can't be fitted). 
[AP] Sometimes they work if you use Nelder-Mead, but it gets kind of wishy-washy.
885		loop, each `tune_interval` iterations. 
897		Gibbs step methods are not in the sandbox anymore.
[AP] They are in my checkout...
[DH] I got confused because there is a Gibbs StepMethod in StepMethods.py, but it's a dummy I guess. 
925		How ?
927		More info. 
938		Provide more info about the method. 
952		step method printed output. 
954		cite and add a reference. 
[AP] You mean a reference for conjugate submodels in addition to Wikipedia, or the fact that they can be handled by Gibbs? I guess the latter is probably in Gilks, but would need to look.
[DH] I mean display it as a reference and put the full url in the references section.
961		not in the sandbox anymore.
[AP] If they aren't, they should be. :)
[DH] Again, my bad.
