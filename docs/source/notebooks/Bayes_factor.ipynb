    "\n",
    "Now we will briefly discuss some key facts about the _marginal likelihood_\n",
    "\n",
    "* The good\n",
    "    * **Occam Razor included**: Models with more parameters have a larger penalization than models with fewer parameters. The intuitive reason is that the larger the number of parameters the more _spread_ the _prior_ with respect to the likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The bad\n",
    "    * Computing the marginal likelihood is, generally, a hard task because it’s an integral of a highly variable function over a high dimensional parameter space. In general this integral needs to be solved numerically using more or less sophisticated methods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$p(y \\mid M_k) = \\int_{\\theta_k} p(y \\mid \\theta_k, M_k) p(\\theta_k, M_k) d\\theta_k$$\n",

    "    * The marginal likelihood depends **sensitively** on the specified prior $p(\\theta_k \\mid M_k)$ for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that _the good_ and _the ugly_ are related. Using the marginal likelihood to compare models is a good idea because a penalization for complex models is already included (thus preventing us from overfitting) and, at the same time, a change in the prior will affect the computations of the _marginal likelihood_. At first this sounds a little bit silly we already know that priors affect computations (otherwise we could simply avoid them), but the point here is the word **sensitively**. We are talking about changes in the prior that will keep inference of $\\theta$ more or less the same, but could have a big impact in the value of the marginal likelihood."

    "## Computing Bayes factors\n",
    "\n",
    "The _marginal likelihood_ is generally not available in closed-form except for some restricted models. For this reason many methods have been devised to compute the _marginal likelihood_ and the derived Bayes factors, some of these methods are so simple and [naive](https://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2008/08/17/the-harmonic-mean-of-the-likelihood-worst-monte-carlo-method-ever/) that works very bad in practice. Most of the useful methods have been originally proposed in the field of Statistical Mechanics. This connection is explained because the marginal likelihood is analogous to a central quantity in statistical physics known as the _partition function_ which in turn is closely related to another very important quantity the _free-energy_. Many of the connections between Statistical Mechanics and Bayesian inference are summarized [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01428)."

    "### Using a hierarchical model\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation of Bayes factors can be framed as a hierarchical model, where the high-level parameter is an index assigned to each model and sampled from a categorical distribution. In other words, we perform inference for two (or more) competing models at the same time and we use a discrete _dummy_ variable that _jumps_ between models. How much time we spend sampling each model is proportional to $p(M_k \\mid y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common problems when computing Bayes factors this way is that if one model is better than the other, by definition, we will spend more time sampling from it than from the other model. And this could lead to inaccuracies because we will be undersampling the less likely model. Another problem is that the values of the parameters get updated even when the parameters are not used to fit that model. That is, when model 0 is chosen, parameters in model 1 are updated but since they are not used to explain the data, they only get restricted by the prior. If the prior is too vague, it is possible that when we choose model 1, the parameter values are too far away from the previous accepted values and hence the step is rejected. Therefore we end up having a problem with sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case we find these problems, we can try to improve sampling by implementing two modifications to our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ideally, we can get a better sampling of both models if they are visited equally, so we can adjust the prior for each model in such a way to favour the less favourable model and disfavour the most favourable one. This will not affect the computation of the Bayes factor because we have to include the priors in the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use pseudo priors, as suggested by Kruschke and others. The idea is simple: if the problem is that the parameters drift away unrestricted, when the model they belong to is not selected, then one solution is to try to restrict them artificially, but only when not used! You can find an example of using pseudo priors in a model used by Kruschke in his book and [ported](https://github.com/aloctavodia/Doing_bayesian_ data_analysis.) to Python/PyMC3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about this approach to the computation of the marginal likelihood see [Chapter 12 of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780124058880).

    "In this example the observed data $y$ is more consistent with `model_1` (because the prior is concentrated around the correct value of $\theta$) than `model_0` (which assigns equal probability to every possible value of $\theta$), and this difference is captured by the Bayes factors. We could say Bayes factors are measuring which model, as a whole, is better, including details of the prior that may be irrelevant for parameter inference. In fact in this example we can also see that it is possible to have two different models, with different Bayes factors, but nevertheless get very similar predictions. The reason is that the data is informative enough to reduce the effect of the prior up to the point of inducing a very similar posterior. As predictions are computed from the posterior we also get very similar predictions. In most scenarios when comparing models what we really care is the predictive accuracy of the models, if two models have similar predictive accuracy we consider both models as similar. To estimate the predictive accuracy we can use tools like WAIC, LOO or cross-validation."
