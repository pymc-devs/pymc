    "[PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/index.html) is a great tool for doing Bayesian inference and parameter estimation. It has a load of [in-built probability distributions](https://docs.pymc.io/api/distributions.html) that you can use to set up priors and likelihood functions for your particular model. You can even create your own [custom distributions](https://docs.pymc.io/prob_dists.html#custom-distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not necessarily that simple if you have a model function, or probability distribution, that, for example, relies on an external code that you have little/no control over (and may even be, for example, wrapped `C` code rather than Python). This can be problematic went you need to pass parameters set as PyMC3 distributions to these external functions; your external function probably wants you to pass it floating point numbers rather than PyMC3 distributions!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymc3 as pm:\n",
    "from external_module import my_external_func  # your external function!\n",
    "\n",
    "# set up your model\n",
    "with pm.Model():\n",
    "    # your external function takes two parameters, a and b, with Uniform priors\n",
    "    a = pm.Uniform('a', lower=0., upper=1.)\n",
    "    b = pm.Uniform('b', lower=0., upper=1.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    m = my_external_func(a, b)  # <--- this is not going to work!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that if you want to be able to use the [gradient-based step samplers](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html#Gradient-based-sampling-methods) like [NUTS](https://docs.pymc.io/api/inference.html#module-pymc3.step_methods.hmc.nuts) and [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)](https://docs.pymc.io/api/inference.html#hamiltonian-monte-carlo), then your model/likelihood needs a gradient to be defined. If you have a model that is defined as a set of Theano operators then this is no problem - internally it will be able to do automatic differentiation - but if your model is essentially a \"black box\" then you won't necessarily know what the gradients are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a model/likelihood that PyMC3 can use and that calls your \"black box\" function is possible, but it relies on creating a [custom Theano Op](https://docs.pymc.io/advanced_theano.html#writing-custom-theano-ops). This is, hopefully, a clear description of how to do this, including one way of writing a gradient function that could be generally applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, we create a very simple model and log-likelihood function in [Cython](http://cython.org/). Cython is used just as an example to show what you might need to do if calling external `C` codes, but you could in fact be using pure Python codes. The log-likelihood function used is actually just a [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), so defining this yourself is obviously overkill (and I'll compare it to doing the same thing purely with the pre-defined PyMC3 [Normal](https://docs.pymc.io/api/distributions/continuous.html#pymc3.distributions.continuous.Normal) distribution), but it should provide a simple to follow demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define a _super-complicated_&trade; model (a straight line!), which is parameterised by two variables (a gradient `m` and a y-intercept `c`) and calculated at a vector of points `x`. Here the model is defined in [Cython](http://cython.org/) and calls [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) functions. This is just to show that you could be calling some other `C` library that you need. In this example, the model parameters are all packed into a list/array/tuple called `theta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also define a _really-complicated_&trade; log-likelihood function (a Normal log-likelihood that ignores the normalisation), which takes in the list/array/tuple of model parameter values `theta`, the points at which to calculate the model `x`, the vector of \"observed\" data points `data`, and the standard deviation of the noise in the data `sigma`. This log-likelihood function calls the _super-complicated_&trade; model function."

But, if our model/likelihood truely is a \"black box\" then we can just use the good-old-fashioned [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) to find the gradients - this can be slow, especially if there are a large number of variables, or the model takes a long time to evaluate. Below, a function to find gradients has been defined that uses the finite difference (the central difference) - it uses an iterative method with successively smaller interval sizes to check that the gradient converges.

    "It's not quite so simple! The `grad()` method itself requires that its inputs are Theano tensor variables, whereas our `gradients` function above, like our `my_loglike` function, wants a list of floating point values. So, we need to define another Op that calculates the gradients. Below, I define a new version of the `LogLike` Op, called `LogLikeWithGrad` this time, that has a `grad()` method. This is followed by anothor Op called `LogLikeGrad` that, when called with a vector of Theano tensor variables, returns another vector of values that are the gradients (i.e., the [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)) of our log-likelihood function at those values. Note that the `grad()` method itself does not return the gradients directly, but instead returns the [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)-vector product (you can hopefully just copy what I've done and not worry about what this means too much!)."
