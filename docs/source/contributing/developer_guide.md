# PyMC Developer Guide

{doc}`PyMC <index>` is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling built on top of {doc}`PyTensor <pytensor:index>`.
This document aims to explain the design and implementation of probabilistic programming in PyMC, with comparisons to other PPLs like TensorFlow Probability (TFP) and Pyro.
A user-facing API introduction can be found in the {ref}`API quickstart <pymc_overview>`.
A more accessible, user facing deep introduction can be found in [Peadar Coyle's probabilistic programming primer](https://github.com/springcoil/probabilisticprogrammingprimer).

## Distribution

Probability distributions in PyMC are implemented as classes that inherit from {class}`~pymc.Continuous` or {class}`~pymc.Discrete`.
Either of these inherit {class}`~pymc.Distribution` which defines the high level API.

For a detailed introduction on how a new distribution should be implemented check out the {ref}`guide on implementing distributions <implementing_distribution>`.


## Reflection

How tensor/value semantics for probability distributions are enabled in PyMC:

In PyMC, model variables are defined by calling probability distribution classes with parameters:

```python
z = Normal("z", 0, 5)
```

This is done inside the context of a ``pm.Model``, which intercepts some information, for example to capture known dimensions.
The notation aligns with the typically used math notation:

$$
z \sim \text{Normal}(0, 5)
$$

A call to a {class}`~pymc.Distribution` constructor as shown above returns an PyTensor {class}`~pytensor.tensor.TensorVariable`, which is a symbolic representation of the model variable and the graph of inputs it depends on.
Under the hood, the variables are created through the {meth}`~pymc.Distribution.dist` API, which calls the {class}`~pytensor.tensor.random.basic.RandomVariable` {class}`~pytensor.graph.op.Op` corresponding to the distribution.

At a high level of abstraction, the idea behind ``RandomVariable`` ``Op``s is to create symbolic variables (``TensorVariable``s) that can be associated with the properties of a probability distribution.
For example, the ``RandomVariable`` ``Op`` which becomes part of the symbolic computation graph is associated with the random number generators or probability mass/density functions of the distribution.

In the example above, where the ``TensorVariable`` ``z`` is created to be {math}`\text{Normal}(0, 5)` random variable, we can get a handle on the corresponding ``RandomVariable`` ``Op`` instance:

```python
with pm.Model():
    z = pm.Normal("z", 0, 5)
print(type(z.owner.op))
# ==> pytensor.tensor.random.basic.NormalRV
isinstance(z.owner.op, pytensor.tensor.random.basic.RandomVariable)
# ==> True
```

Now, because the ``NormalRV`` can be associated with the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) of the Normal distribution, we can now evaluate it through the special `pm.logp` function:

```python
with pm.Model():
    z = pm.Normal("z", 0, 5)
symbolic = pm.logp(z, 2.5)
numeric = symbolic.eval()
# array(-2.65337645)
```

We can, of course, also work out the math by hand:

$$
\begin{aligned}
pdf_{\mathcal{N}}(\mu, \sigma, x) &= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp^{- 0.5 (\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2} \\
pdf_{\mathcal{N}}(0, 5, 2.5) &= 0.070413 \\
ln(0.070413) &= -2.6533
\end{aligned}
$$

In the probabilistic programming context, this enables PyMC and its backend PyTensor to create and evaluate computation graphs to compute, for example log-prior or log-likelihood values.


## PyMC in Comparison

Within the PyMC model context, random variables are essentially PyTensor tensors that can be used in all kinds of operations as if they were NumPy arrays.
This is different compared to TFP and pyro, where one needs to be more explicit about the conversion from random variables to tensors.

Consider the following examples, which implement the below model.

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    z &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5) \\
    x &\sim \mathcal{N}(z, 1) \\
    \end{aligned}
$$

### PyMC

```python
with pm.Model() as model:
    z = pm.Normal('z', mu=0., sigma=5.)             # ==> pytensor.tensor.var.TensorVariable
    x = pm.Normal('x', mu=z, sigma=1., observed=5.) # ==> pytensor.tensor.var.TensorVariable
# The log-prior of z=2.5
pm.logp(z, 2.5).eval()                              # ==> -2.65337645
# ???????
x.logp({'z': 2.5})                                  # ==> -4.0439386
# ???????
model.logp({'z': 2.5})                              # ==> -6.6973152
```

### Tensorflow Probability

```python

import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
from tensorflow_probability import distributions as tfd

with tf.Session() as sess:
    z_dist = tfd.Normal(loc=0., scale=5.)            # ==> <class 'tfp.python.distributions.normal.Normal'>
    z = z_dist.sample()                              # ==> <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor'>
    x = tfd.Normal(loc=z, scale=1.).log_prob(5.)     # ==> <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor'>
    model_logp = z_dist.log_prob(z) + x
    print(sess.run(x, feed_dict={z: 2.5}))           # ==> -4.0439386
    print(sess.run(model_logp, feed_dict={z: 2.5}))  # ==> -6.6973152
```

### Pyro

```python
z_dist = dist.Normal(loc=0., scale=5.)           # ==> <class 'pyro.distributions.torch.Normal'>
z = pyro.sample("z", z_dist)                     # ==> <class 'torch.Tensor'>
# reset/specify value of z
z.data = torch.tensor(2.5)
x = dist.Normal(loc=z, scale=1.).log_prob(5.)    # ==> <class 'torch.Tensor'>
model_logp = z_dist.log_prob(z) + x
x                                                # ==> -4.0439386
model_logp                                       # ==> -6.6973152
```


## Behind the scenes of the ``logp`` function

The ``logp`` function is straightforward - it is an PyTensor function within each distribution.
It has the following signature:

:::{warning}
The code block is outdated.
:::

```python
def logp(self, value):
    # GET PARAMETERS
    param1, param2, ... = self.params1, self.params2, ...
    # EVALUATE LOG-LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION, all inputs are (or array that could be convert to) PyTensor tensor
    total_log_prob = f(param1, param2, ..., value)
    return total_log_prob
```

In the ``logp`` method, parameters and values are either PyTensor tensors, or could be converted to tensors.
It is rather convenient as the evaluation of logp is represented as a tensor (``RV.logpt``), and when we linked different ``logp`` together (e.g., summing all ``RVs.logpt`` to get the model total logp) the dependence  is taken care of by PyTensor when the graph is built and compiled.
Again, since the compiled function depends on the nodes that already in the graph, whenever you want to generate a new function that takes new input tensors you either need to regenerate the graph with the appropriate dependencies, or replace the node by editing the existing graph.
In PyMC we use the second approach by using ``pytensor.clone_replace()`` when it is needed.

As explained above, distribution in a ``pm.Model()`` context automatically turn into a tensor with distribution property (PyMC random variable).
To get the logp of a free\_RV is just evaluating the ``logp()`` [on itself](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/model.py#L1212-L1213):

```python
# self is a pytensor.tensor with a distribution attached
self.logp_sum_unscaledt = distribution.logp_sum(self)
self.logp_nojac_unscaledt = distribution.logp_nojac(self)
```

Or for an observed RV. it evaluate the logp on the data:

```python
self.logp_sum_unscaledt = distribution.logp_sum(data)
self.logp_nojac_unscaledt = distribution.logp_nojac(data)
```

### Model context and Random Variable

I like to think that the ``with pm.Model() ...`` is a key syntax feature and *the* signature of PyMC model language, and in general a great out-of-the-box thinking/usage of the context manager in Python (with some critics, of course).

Essentially [what a context manager does](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/) is:

```python
with EXPR as VAR:
    USERCODE
```

which roughly translates into this:

```python
VAR = EXPR
VAR.__enter__()
try:
    USERCODE
finally:
    VAR.__exit__()
```

or conceptually:

```python
with EXPR as VAR:
    # DO SOMETHING
    USERCODE
    # DO SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS
```

So what happened within the ``with pm.Model() as model: ...`` block, besides the initial set up ``model = pm.Model()``?
Starting from the most elementary:

### Random Variable

From the above session, we know that when we call e.g. ``pm.Normal('x', ...)`` within a Model context, it returns a random variable.
Thus, we have two equivalent ways of adding random variable to a model:

```python
with pm.Model() as m:
    x = pm.Normal('x', mu=0., sigma=1.)

print(type(x))                              # ==> <class 'pytensor.tensor.var.TensorVariable'>
print(m.free_RVs)                           # ==> [x]
print(logpt(x, 5.0))                        # ==> Elemwise{switch,no_inplace}.0
print(logpt(x, 5.).eval({}))                # ==> -13.418938533204672
print(m.logp({'x': 5.}))                    # ==> -13.418938533204672
```

In general, if a variable has observations (``observed`` parameter), the RV is an observed RV, otherwise if it has a ``transformed`` (``transform`` parameter) attribute, it is a transformed RV otherwise, it will be the most elementary form: a free RV.
Note that this means that random variables with observations cannot be transformed.

<!--
Below, I will take a deeper look into transformed RV. A normal user
might not necessarily come in contact with the concept, since a
transformed RV and ``TransformedDistribution`` are intentionally not
user facing.

Because in PyMC there is no bijector class like in TFP or pyro, we only
have a partial implementation called ``Transform``, which implements
Jacobian correction for forward mapping only (there is no Jacobian
correction for inverse mapping). The use cases we considered are limited
to the set of distributions that are bounded, and the transformation
maps the bounded set to the real line - see
{ref}`API quickstart <pymc_overview#Automatic-transforms-of-bounded-RVs>`.
However, other transformations are possible.
In general, PyMC does not provide explicit functionality to transform
one distribution to another. Instead, a dedicated distribution is
usually created in order to optimise performance. But getting a
``TransformedDistribution`` is also
possible (see also in
{ref}`doc <pymc_overview##Transformed-distributions-and-changes-of-variables>`):

.. code:: python


    lognorm = Exp().apply(pm.Normal.dist(0., 1.))
    lognorm


.. parsed-literal::

    <pymc.distributions.transforms.TransformedDistribution at 0x7f1536749b00>



Now, back to ``model.RV(...)`` - things returned from ``model.RV(...)``
are PyTensor tensor variables, and it is clear from looking at
``TransformedRV``:

.. code:: python

    class TransformedRV(TensorVariable):
        ...

as for ``FreeRV`` and ``ObservedRV``, they are ``TensorVariable``\s with
``Factor`` as mixin:

.. code:: python

    class FreeRV(Factor, TensorVariable):
        ...

``Factor`` basically `enable and assign the
logp <https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/model.py#L195-L276>`__
(represented as a tensor also) property to an PyTensor tensor (thus
making it a random variable). For a ``TransformedRV``, it transforms the
distribution into a ``TransformedDistribution``, and then ``model.Var`` is
called again to added the RV associated with the
``TransformedDistribution`` as a ``FreeRV``:

.. code:: python

        ...
        self.transformed = model.Var(
                    transformed_name, transform.apply(distribution), total_size=total_size)

note: after ``transform.apply(distribution)`` its ``.transform``
property is set to ``None``, thus making sure that the above call will
only add one ``FreeRV``. In another word, you *cannot* do chain
transformation by nested applying multiple transforms to a Distribution
(however, you can use ``Chain`` transformation.

.. code:: python

    z = pm.LogNormal.dist(mu=0., sigma=1., transform=tr.Log)
    z.transform           # ==> pymc.distributions.transforms.Log


.. code:: python

    z2 = Exp().apply(z)
    z2.transform is None  # ==> True
-->


### Additional things that ``pm.Model`` does

In a way, ``pm.Model`` is a tape machine that records what is being added to the model, it keeps track the random variables (observed or unobserved) and potential term (additional tensor that to be added to the model logp), and also deterministic transformation (as bookkeeping):
* named\_vars
* free\_RVs
* observed\_RVs
* deterministics
* potentials
* missing\_values
The model context then computes some simple model properties, builds a bijection mapping that transforms between dictionary and numpy/PyTensor ndarray, thus allowing the ``logp``/``dlogp`` functions to have two equivalent versions:
One takes a ``dict`` as input and the other takes an ``ndarray`` as input.
More importantly, a ``pm.Model()`` contains methods to compile PyTensor functions that take Random Variables (that are also initialised within the same model) as input, for example:

```python
with pm.Model() as m:
    z = pm.Normal('z', 0., 10., shape=10)
    x = pm.Normal('x', z, 1., shape=10)

print(m.initial_point)
print(m.dict_to_array(m.initial_point))  # ==> m.bijection.map(m.initial_point)
print(m.bijection.rmap(np.arange(20)))
# {'z': array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), 'x': array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])}
# [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
# {'z': array([10., 11., 12., 13., 14., 15., 16., 17., 18., 19.]), 'x': array([0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.])}
```

```python
list(filter(lambda x: "logp" in x, dir(pm.Model)))
#['d2logp',
# 'd2logp_nojac',
# 'datalogpt',
# 'dlogp',
# 'dlogp_array',
# 'dlogp_nojac',
# 'fastd2logp',
# 'fastd2logp_nojac',
# 'fastdlogp',
# 'fastdlogp_nojac',
# 'fastlogp',
# 'fastlogp_nojac',
# 'logp',
# 'logp_array',
# 'logp_dlogp_function',
# 'logp_elemwise',
# 'logp_nojac',
# 'logp_nojact',
# 'logpt',
# 'varlogpt']
```

### Logp and dlogp

The model collects all the random variables (everything in ``model.free_RVs`` and ``model.observed_RVs``) and potential term, and sum them together to get the model logp:

```python
@property
def logpt(self):
    """PyTensor scalar of log-probability of the model"""
    with self:
        factors = [var.logpt for var in self.basic_RVs] + self.potentials
        logp = at.sum([at.sum(factor) for factor in factors])
        ...
        return logp
```

which returns an PyTensor tensor that its value depends on the free parameters in the model (i.e., its parent nodes from the PyTensor graph).
You can evaluate or compile into a python callable (that you can pass numpy as input args).
Note that the logp tensor depends on its input in the PyTensor graph, thus you cannot pass new tensor to generate a logp function.
For similar reason, in PyMC we do graph copying a lot using pytensor.clone_replace to replace the inputs to a tensor.

```python
with pm.Model() as m:
    z = pm.Normal('z', 0., 10., shape=10)
    x = pm.Normal('x', z, 1., shape=10)
    y = pm.Normal('y', x.sum(), 1., observed=2.5)

print(m.basic_RVs)    # ==> [z, x, y]
print(m.free_RVs)     # ==> [z, x]

type(m.logpt)
# pytensor.tensor.var.TensorVariable

m.logpt.eval({x: np.random.randn(*x.tag.test_value.shape) for x in m.free_RVs})
# array(-51.25369126)
```


PyMC then compiles a logp function with gradient that takes ``model.free_RVs`` as input and ``model.logpt`` as output.
It could be a subset of tensors in ``model.free_RVs`` if we want a conditional logp/dlogp function:

```python
def logp_dlogp_function(self, grad_vars=None, **kwargs):
    if grad_vars is None:
        grad_vars = list(typefilter(self.free_RVs, continuous_types))
    else:
        ...
    varnames = [var.name for var in grad_vars]  # In a simple case with only continuous RVs,
                                                # this is all the free_RVs
    extra_vars = [var for var in self.free_RVs if var.name not in varnames]
    return ValueGradFunction(self.logpt, grad_vars, extra_vars, **kwargs)
```

``ValueGradFunction`` is a callable class which isolates part of the PyTensor graph to compile additional PyTensor functions.
PyMC relies on ``pytensor.clone_replace`` to copy the ``model.logpt`` and replace its input.
It does not edit or rewrite the graph directly.

The important parts of the above function is highlighted and commented.
On a high level, it allows us to build conditional logp function and its gradient easily.
Here is a taste of how it works in action:

```python
inputlist = [np.random.randn(*x.tag.test_value.shape) for x in m.free_RVs]

func = m.logp_dlogp_function()
func.set_extra_values({})
input_dict = {x.name: y for x, y in zip(m.free_RVs, inputlist)}
print(input_dict)
input_array = func.dict_to_array(input_dict)
print(input_array)
print(" ===== ")
func(input_array)

```


So why is this necessary?
One can imagine that we just compile one logp function, and do bookkeeping ourselves.
For example, we can build the logp function in PyTensor directly:

```python
import pytensor
func = pytensor.function(m.free_RVs, m.logpt)
func(*inputlist)
# array(-51.0769075)

logpt_grad = pytensor.grad(m.logpt, m.free_RVs)
func_d = pytensor.function(m.free_RVs, logpt_grad)
func_d(*inputlist)
# [array([ 0.74230226,  0.01658948,  1.38606194,  0.11253699, -1.07003284,
#          2.64302891,  1.12497754, -0.35967542, -1.18117557, -1.11489642]),
#  array([ 0.98281586,  1.69545542,  0.34626619,  1.61069443,  2.79155183,
#         -0.91020295,  0.60094326,  2.08022672,  2.8799075 ,  2.81681213])]
```


Similarly, build a conditional logp:

```python
shared = pytensor.shared(inputlist[1])
func2 = pytensor.function([m.free_RVs[0]], m.logpt, givens=[(m.free_RVs[1], shared)])
print(func2(inputlist[0]))
# -51.07690750130328

logpt_grad2 = pytensor.grad(m.logpt, m.free_RVs[0])
func_d2 = pytensor.function([m.free_RVs[0]], logpt_grad2, givens=[(m.free_RVs[1], shared)])
print(func_d2(inputlist[0]))
# [ 0.74230226  0.01658948  1.38606194  0.11253699 -1.07003284  2.64302891
#   1.12497754 -0.35967542 -1.18117557 -1.11489642]
```

The above also gives the same logp and gradient as the output from ``model.logp_dlogp_function``.
But the difficulty is to compile everything into a single function:

```python
func_logp_and_grad = pytensor.function(m.free_RVs, [m.logpt, logpt_grad])
# ==> ERROR
```

We want to have a function that return the evaluation and its gradient re each input:
``value, grad = f(x)``, but the naive implementation does not work.
We can of course wrap 2 functions - one for logp one for dlogp - and output a list.
But that would mean we need to call 2 functions.
In addition, when we write code using python logic to do bookkeeping when we build our conditional logp.
Using ``pytensor.clone_replace``, we always have the input to the PyTensor function being a 1d vector (instead of a list of RV that each can have very different shape), thus it is very easy to do matrix operation like rotation etc.

### Notes
The current setup is quite powerful, as the PyTensor compiled function is fairly fast to compile and to call.
Also, when we are repeatedly calling a conditional logp function, external RV only need to reset once.
However, there are still significant overheads when we are passing values between PyTensor graph and NumPy.
That is the reason we often see no advantage in using GPU, because the data is copying between GPU and CPU at each function call - and for a small model, the result is a slower inference under GPU than CPU.

Also, ``pytensor.clone_replace`` is too convenient (PyMC internal joke is that it is like a drug - very addictive).
If all the operation happens in the graph (including the conditioning and setting value), I see no need to isolate part of the graph (via graph copying or graph rewriting) for building model and running inference.

Moreover, if we are limiting to the problem that we can solved most confidently - model with all continuous unknown parameters that could be sampled with dynamic HMC, there is even less need to think about graph cloning/rewriting.

## Inference

### MCMC
The ability for model instance to generate conditional logp and dlogp function enable one of the unique feature of PyMC - {class}`~pymc.CompoundStep` method.
On a conceptual level it is a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler.
Users can specify different sampler for different RVs.
Alternatively, it is implemented as yet another interceptor:
The ``pm.sample(...)`` call will try to [assign the best step methods to different free\_RVs](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/sampling.py#L86-L152) (e.g., NUTS if all free\_RVs are continuous).
Then, (conditional) logp function(s) are compiled, and the sampler called each sampler within the list of CompoundStep in a for-loop for one sample circle.

For each sampler, it implements a ``step.step`` method to perform MH updates.
Each time a dictionary (``point`` in PyMC land, same structure as ``model.initial_point``) is passed as input and output a new dictionary with the free\_RVs being sampled now has a new value (if accepted, see [here](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/step_methods/compound.py#L27) and [here](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/step_methods/compound.py)).
There are some example in the ``CompoundStep`` doc:

#### Transition kernel
The base class for most MCMC sampler (except SMC) is in [ArrayStep](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/step_methods/arraystep.py).
You can see that the ``step.step()`` is mapping the ``point`` into an array, and call ``self.astep()``, which is an array in, array out function.
A PyMC model compiles a conditional logp/dlogp function that replace the input RVs with a shared 1D tensor (flatten and stack view of the original RVs).
And the transition kernel (i.e., ``.astep()``) takes an array as input and outputs an array.
For example, see the [MH sampler](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/89f6fcf751774fb50016561dc448a87fba7ed3aa/pymc/step_methods/metropolis.py#L235-L289).

This is of course very different compared to the transition kernel in e.g. TFP, which is a tenor in tensor out function.
Moreover, transition kernels in TFP do not flatten the tensors, see eg docstring of [tensorflow\_probability/python/mcmc/random\_walk\_metropolis.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/main/tensorflow_probability/python/mcmc/random_walk_metropolis.py):

```python
        new_state_fn: Python callable which takes a list of state parts and a
        seed; returns a same-type `list` of `Tensor`s, each being a perturbation
        of the input state parts. The perturbation distribution is assumed to be
        a symmetric distribution centered at the input state part.
        Default value: `None` which is mapped to
            `tfp.mcmc.random_walk_normal_fn()`.
```

#### Dynamic HMC
We love NUTS, or to be more precise Dynamic HMC with complex stopping rules.
This part is actually all done outside of PyTensor, for NUTS, it includes:
The leapfrog, dual averaging, tuning of mass matrix and step size, the tree building, sampler related statistics like divergence and energy checking.
We actually have an PyTensor version of HMC, but it has never been used, and has been removed from the main repository.
It can still be found in the [git history](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/3734/commits/0fdae8207fd14f66635f3673ef267b2b8817aa68), though.

#### Variational Inference (VI)
The design of the VI module takes a different approach than MCMC - it has a functional design, and everything is done within PyTensor (i.e., Optimization and building the variational objective).
The base class of variational inference is [pymc.variational.Inference](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/variational/inference.py), where it builds the objective function by calling:

```python
...
self.objective = op(approx, **kwargs)(tf)
...
```

Where:

```
op     : Operator class
approx : Approximation class or instance
tf     : TestFunction instance
kwargs { kwargs passed to :class}`Operator`
```

The design is inspired by the great work [Operator Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09033).
``Inference`` object is a very high level of VI implementation.
It uses primitives: Operator, Approximation, and Test functions to combine them into single objective function.
Currently we do not care too much about the test function, it is usually not required (and not implemented).
The other primitives are defined as base classes in [this file](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/variational/opvi.py).
We use inheritance to easily implement a broad class of VI methods leaving a lot of flexibility for further extensions.

For example, consider ADVI.
We know that in the high-level, we are approximating the posterior in the latent space with a diagonal Multivariate Gaussian.
In another word, we are approximating each elements in ``model.free_RVs`` with a Gaussian.
Below is what happen in the set up:

```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(ADVI, self).__init__(MeanField(*args, **kwargs))
# ==> In the super class KLqp
    super(KLqp, self).__init__(KL, MeanField(*args, **kwargs), None, beta=beta)
# ==> In the super class Inference
    ...
    self.objective = KL(MeanField(*args, **kwargs))(None)
    ...
```

where ``KL`` is Operator based on Kullback Leibler Divergence (it does not need any test function).

```python
...
def apply(self, f):
    return -self.datalogp_norm + self.beta * (self.logq_norm - self.varlogp_norm)
```

Since the logp and logq are from the approximation, let's dive in further on it (there is another abstraction here - ``Group`` - that allows you to combine approximation into new approximation, but we will skip this for now and only consider ``SingleGroupApproximation`` like ``MeanField``):
The definition of ``datalogp_norm``, ``logq_norm``, ``varlogp_norm`` are in [variational/opvi](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/variational/opvi.py), strip away the normalizing term, ``datalogp`` and ``varlogp`` are expectation of the variational free\_RVs and data logp - we clone the datalogp and varlogp from the model, replace its input with PyTensor tensor that [samples from the variational posterior](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/variational/opvi.py#L1098-L1111).
For ADVI, these samples are from [a Gaussian](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/variational/approximations.py#L84-L89).
Note that the samples from the posterior approximations are usually 1 dimension more, so that we can compute the expectation and get the gradient of the expectation (by computing the [expectation of the gradient!](http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/10/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-4-reparameterisation-tricks/)).
As for the [`logq`` since it is a Gaussian `it is pretty straightforward to evaluate](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/variational/approximations.py#L91-L97).

##### Some challenges and insights from implementing VI.
-  Graph based approach was helpful, but PyTensor had no direct access to previously created nodes in the computational graph.
   You can find a lot of ``@node_property`` usages in implementation.
   This is done to cache nodes.
   TensorFlow has graph utils for that that could potentially help in doing this.
   On the other hand graph management in Tensorflow seemed to more tricky than expected.
   The high level reason is that graph is an add only container.
-  There were few fixed bugs not obvious in the first place.
   PyTensor has a tool to manipulate the graph (``pytensor.clone_replace``) and this tool requires extremely careful treatment when doing a lot of graph replacements at different level.
-  We coined a term ``pytensor.clone_replace`` curse.
   We got extremely dependent on this feature.
   Internal usages are uncountable:
   -  We use this to [vectorize the model](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/model.py#L972) for both MCMC and VI to speed up computations
   -  We use this to [create sampling graph](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/main/pymc/variational/opvi.py#L1483) for VI. This is the case you want posterior predictive as a part of computational graph.

As this is the core of the VI process, we were trying to replicate this pattern in TF.
However, when ``pytensor.clone_replace`` is called, PyTensor creates a new part of the graph that can be collected by garbage collector, but TF's graph is add only.
So we should solve the problem of replacing input in a different way.

### Forward sampling
As explained above, in distribution we have method to walk the model dependence graph and generate forward random sample in scipy/numpy.
This allows us to do prior predictive samples using [`pymc.sampling.sample_prior_predictive`` see `code](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/blob/6d07591962a6c135640a3c31903eba66b34e71d8/pymc/sampling.py#L1303-L1345).
It is a fairly fast batch operation, but we have quite a lot of bugs and edge case especially in high dimensions.
The biggest pain point is the automatic broadcasting.
As in the batch random generation, we want to generate (n\_sample, ) + RV.shape random samples.
In some cases, where we broadcast RV1 and RV2 to create a RV3 that has one more batch shape, we get error (even worse, wrong answer with silent error).

The good news is, we are fixing these errors with the amazing works from [lucianopaz](https://github.com/lucianopaz) and others.
The challenge and some summary of the solution could be found in Luciano's [blog post](https://lucianopaz.github.io/2019/08/19/pymc3-shape-handling/)

```python
with pm.Model() as m:
    mu = pm.Normal('mu', 0., 1., shape=(5, 1))
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal('sigma', 5., shape=(1, 10))
    pm.Normal('x', mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=np.random.randn(2, 5, 10))
    trace = pm.sample_prior_predictive(100)

trace['x'].shape # ==> should be (100, 2, 5, 10)

pm.Normal.dist(mu=np.zeros(2), sigma=1).random(size=(10, 4))
```

There are also other error related random sample generation (e.g., [Mixture is currently broken](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/issues/3270)).

    -  Connecting to Julia for solving ODE (with gradient for solution that can be used in NUTS)

### What we got wrong

#### Shape
One of the pain point we often face is the issue of shape.
The approach in TFP and pyro is currently much more rigorous.
Adrian’s PR (https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/2833) might fix this problem, but likely it is a huge effort of refactoring.
I implemented quite a lot of patches for mixture distribution, but still they are not done very naturally.

#### Random methods in numpy
There is a lot of complex logic for sampling from random variables, and because it is all in Python, we can't transform a sampling graph further.
Unfortunately, PyTensor does not have code to sample from various distributions and we didn't want to write that our own.

#### Samplers are in Python
While having the samplers be written in Python allows for a lot of flexibility and intuitive for experiment (writing e.g. NUTS in PyTensor is also very difficult), it comes at a performance penalty and makes sampling on the GPU very inefficient because memory needs to be copied for every logp evaluation.
