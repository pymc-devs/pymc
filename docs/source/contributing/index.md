# Contributing

PyMC is an open source, collective effort.
There are many ways in which you can help make it better.
And all of them are welcome!

## Contribute as an individual
PyMC is a joint effort of many people, each contributing to the areas they like
and have some expertise in, coordinating to try and cover all tasks.

Coding and documentation are the most common types of contributions, but
there are many more things that you can do to help PyMC which are just as
important. Moreover, both code and docs require submitting PRs via GitHub
to some of the repositories under the [pymc-devs](https://github.com/pymc-devs) organization, and
while we have a {ref}`pr_tutorial` guide available, GitHub might not be
everyone's cup of tea. If that is your case, don't worry, you will be
more than welcome if you want to help.

Contact us on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/) if you want to contribute to the project but are not sure where you can contribute or how to start

Below there are some examples of non code nor doc contributions that could serve as an inspiration.
If you have other ideas let us know on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/) to see if we can make it happen too.

* Report a bug or make a suggestion for improvement by [opening an issue in Github](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/issues/new/choose)
* Answer questions on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/)
* Teach about PyMC and advertise best practices by writing blogs or giving talks
* Help plan PyMCon
* Help with outreach and marketing. This could include for example reaching out to potential sponsor
  companies, to people who could use PyMC in their work or making sure that academics who use PyMC
  cite it correctly in their work
* Help with our fundraising efforts
