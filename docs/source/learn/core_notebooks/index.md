# Notebooks on core features

:::{note}
**Looking for more examples?**

The notebooks below focus on core PyMC features and are executed with each
version of the library (available via the navigation bar).

A much larger gallery of example notebooks is available in the
{doc}`Examples tab <nb:gallery>`. These are executed more sparsely and
independently, and include a watermark indicating which PyMC version was
used to run them.
