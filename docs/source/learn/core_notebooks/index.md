:::{note}
The notebooks above are executed with each version of the library
(available on the navigation bar). In addition, a much larger gallery
of example notebooks is available at the {doc}`"Examples" tab <nb:gallery>`.
These are executed more sparsely and independently.
They include a watermark to show which versions were used to run them.
