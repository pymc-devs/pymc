:::{grid-item-card} Bayesian Methods for Hackers
:img-top: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a0aca82ca82efab71747d00db30f3a68de98e82/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f36444b596250622e706e673f31
By Cameron Davidson-Pilon

The "hacker" in the title  means learn-as-you-code. This hands-on introduction teaches intuitive definitions of the Bayesian approach to statistics, worklflow and decision-making by applying them using PyMC.

:::{grid-item-card} Bayesian Analysis with Python
:img-top: https://aloctavodia.github.io/img/BAP.jpg

By Osvaldo Martin


A great introductory book written by a maintainer of PyMC. It provides a hands-on introduction to the main concepts of Bayesian statistics using synthetic and real data sets. Mastering the concepts in this book is a great foundation to pursue more advanced knowledge.
