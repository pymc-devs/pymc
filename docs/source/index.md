:::{card} Announcements: library name change and launching PyMC 4.0!
:width: 75%
:margin: auto

We have two major announcements that we're excited to share. First of all, a new name for our library: the PyMC3 library you know and love is now called PyMC. PyMC3 still exists, as a specific major release between PyMC2 and PyMC 4.0. Read more about the renaming and how to solve related issues you might experience from this update [here]().

This ties into our second announcement, which is that we are hereby launching the newest version of PyMC: PyMC 4.0! Read more about this new release [here]().

# Main Features & Benefits

::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:::{grid-item-card}  Friendly modelling API
PyMC allows you to write down models using an intuitive syntax to describe a data generating process.
:::
:::{grid-item-card}  Cutting edge algorithms and model building blocks
Fit your model using gradient-based MCMC algorithms like NUTS, using ADVI for fast approximate inference — including minibatch-ADVI for scaling to large datasets — or using Gaussian processes to build Bayesian nonparametric models.
