PyMC is a python module that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a
python class. It is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite of
problems. PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-
fit and convergence diagnostics.

\label{features}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm so you can focus on your
application instead of on gory numerical algorithms.

\item {} 
Define your distribution from 24 well-documented statistical distributions,

\item {} 
Summarize your results in tables and plots.

\item {} 
Run convergence diagnostics.

\end{itemize}

\label{what-s-new-in-2-0}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Faster internal logic by coding the bottlenecks with Pyrex,

\item {} 
Faster distributions by an optimization of the Fortran functions,

\item {} 
Added a Joint Metropolis and a Gibbs sampler,

\item {} 
Define your problem in a separate file using the Node, Data and Parameter
classes. Use decorators to improve code readability.

\item {} 
Save your samples directly to a database. Select one from sqlite, MySQL, HDF5,
pickle files, text files or write a custom database backend from a template.

\item {} 
Run interactive convergence diagnostics,

\item {} 
Stop a sampling run in the middle, save it's state and restart the sampler
later,

\item {} 
Seed multiple chains on different processors.

\end{itemize}

\label{usage}

From a python shell, type:
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
import~PyMC~\\
S~=~PyMC.Sampler(problem{\_}definition,~db='pickle')~\\
S.sample(iter=10000,~burn=5000,~thin=2)
}\end{quote}

where problem{\_}definition is a module or a dictionary containing Node, Data and
Parameter instances defining your problem. Read the \href{docs/pdf/new_interface.pdf}{user guide} for a
complete description of the package, classes and some examples to get started.

PyMC began development in 2003, as an effort to generalize the process of building Metropolis-Hastimgs samplers, with an aim to making Markov chain Monte Carlo more accessible to non-statisticians (particularly ecologists). The choice to develop PyMC as a python module, rather than a standalone application, allowed the use MCMC methods in a larger modeling framework, in contrast to the BUGS environment. By 2005, PyMC was reliable enough for version 1.0 to be released to the public. A small group of regular users, most associated with the University of Georgia, provided much of the feedback necessary for the refinement of PyMC to its current state.

In 2006, David Huard and Anand Patil joined Chris Fonnesbeck on the development team for PyMC 2.0. This iteration of the software strives for more flexibility, better performance and a better end-user experience than any previous version of PyMC.
