** jss: A Document Class for Publications in the **
**        Journal of Statistical Software        **
***************************************************

This zip-archive contains the pdfLaTeX infrastructure
for publications in the Journal of Statistical Software.
The files
  - jss.cls (LaTeX2e class)
  - jss.bst (BibTeX style)
  - jsslogo.jpg (JPG logo)
need to be included in your search path (local working
directory, texmf or localtexmf tree).

A manual how to use jss.cls is provided in
  - jss.pdf.

Furthermore, there are templates for articles, code
snippets, book reviews and software reviews available
in 
  - article.tex
  - codesnippet.tex
  - bookreview.tex
  - softwarereview.tex

The final version of JSS papers should be prepared using
JSS styles; the submission of the final version needs to
include the full sources (.tex, .bib, and all graphics).
A quick check for the most important aspects of the JSS
style is given below; authors should make sure that all
of them are addressed in the final version:  
  - The manuscript can be compiled by pdfLaTeX.
  - \proglang, \pkg and \code has been used for highlighting
    throughout the paper (including references).    
  - References are provided in a .bib BibTeX database
    and included in the text by \cite, \citep, \citet,
    etc.
  - Titles and headers are formatted as described in
    the JSS manual:
      - \title in title style,
      - \section etc. in sentence style,
      - all titles in the BibTeX file in title style.
  - Figures, tables and equations are marked with a \label
    and referred to by \ref, e.g., "Figure~\ref{...}".
  - Software packes are \cite{}d properly.
For more details, see the manual jss.pdf, in particular
the style checklist in Section 2.1.
