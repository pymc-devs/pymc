## What's Changed
### Major Changes ðŸ› 
* Bump PyTensor dependency and drop support for NumPy <2.0, and Python 3.10 by @ricardoV94 in https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/7910
  * Functions that try to infer inputs of the graph fail with more than one input. This includes `Model.compile_fn`, `gradient`, `jacobian` and `hessian_diag`.
  * `Model.compile_logp` now expects all model variables as input, even when only a subset of the logp terms is requested.
  * Many pytensor functions from moved from `pytensor.graph.basic` to `pytensor.graph.traversal`, including `ancestors`, `graph_inputs`, and toposort related functions.
* Remove deprecated `noise` parameter for GPs by @williambdean in https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/7886

### New Features ðŸŽ‰
* Implement `logcdf` for `CensoredRV` by @asifzubair in https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/7884
* Derive logprob for Split operation by @ricardoV94 in https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pull/7875
